Hi, I am Anurag Sharma. I am a from the CSE department. I come from U.P. I like to code just because it feels good after solving the problems, so basically I like the problem solving part of it. I am familiar with Python, C and C++. I tried learning some Web-Dev during the vacations but didn't complete the backend part yet. Apart from Coding, I play online chess like crazy although I don't improve at all. Also, I also write poems and stuff whenever I feel like it.
